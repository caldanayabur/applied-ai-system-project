# 🎵 Music Recommender Simulation

## Project Summary

This is a simple music recommender for learning. It suggests songs from a small list based on what you like—such as genre, mood, and energy. Songs get points for matching your preferences, and the top ones are recommended with a short reason why. The project shows how basic recommenders work and where they can be limited or biased.

## How The System Works

The `Recommender` system should store a list of songs, then use a Gaussian scoring function to compute one score per feature, then weighted average those scores to get a final score for each song. Each feature should have weight, for example, genre should have more weight than mood because genre is more specific to an user's taste.

Each `Song` should use the features energy, tempo_bpm, valence, danceability, acousticness, genre, and mood.

`UserProfile` should store the user's favorite genre, favorite mood, target energy, and if they like acoustic music.

The songs with the highest scores are recommended to the user. I want for the user to be able to specify how many songs they want to be recommended.

**What features does each Song use?**
- genre, mood, artist, energy, tempo_bpm, valence, danceability, acousticness

**What information does your UserProfile store?**
- favorite genre, favorite mood, favorite artist (optional), target energy, target tempo, target valence, target danceability, target acousticness, number of recommendations wanted

**How does your Recommender compute a score for each song?**
- For each song, add points for matching genre (+2), mood (+1), artist (+1), and for being close to the user's targets for energy, tempo, valence, danceability, and acousticness (+1 each if within a threshold). Add a similarity score for energy (1 - absolute difference).

**How do you choose which songs to recommend?**
- After scoring all songs, sort them by score and recommend the top K songs as requested by the user.

**Potential Bias Note:**  
This system might over-prioritize genre, so it could ignore great songs that match the user's mood or other preferences but are in a different genre. It may also favor songs with features close to the user's targets, even if those features are less important to the user.

#### Individual User Profile Outputs

**User Profile 1**  
Impossible match: genre and mood not in dataset, extreme energy

![User_Profile_1 Output](User_Profile_1.png)

**User Profile 2**  
Contradictory: likes acoustic but wants high energy and danceability

![User_Profile_2 Output](User_Profile_2.png)

**User Profile 3**  
Prefers jazz, relaxed mood, high valence, moderate tempo, and acoustic music

## Getting Started

### Setup

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate      # Mac or Linux
   .venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the app:

```bash
python -m src.main
```

### Running Tests

Run the starter tests with:

```bash
pytest
```

You can add more tests in `tests/test_recommender.py`.

## Experiments You Tried


### What happened when you changed the weight on genre from 2.0 to 0.5
When I set the genre match score to 0.5 instead of 2.0, I realized there was no change for the first user because the feature it considered for the score was energy similarity. For the second user, the top recommendations were the same songs but in a different order. For the third user, songs were the same in the same order, but the score was lower for the first song.

### What happened when you added tempo or valence to the score
The first user got the same recommendations because the feature that mattered was energy similarity. The second one too. The third user got the same recommendations but with higher scores.


### How did your system behave for different types of users?

**User Profile 1** (favorite_genre: k-pop, favorite_mood: melancholy, target_energy: 1.5, likes_acoustic: True)

Top recommendations:

1. Steel Skies (Iron Brigade) — Score: 0.49 — energy similarity (+0.49)
2. Quantum Leap (Future Logic) — Score: 0.47 — energy similarity (+0.47)
3. Gym Hero (Max Pulse) — Score: 0.43 — energy similarity (+0.43)
4. Fiesta Nights (La Rumba) — Score: 0.42 — energy similarity (+0.42)
5. Storm Runner (Voltline) — Score: 0.41 — energy similarity (+0.41)

**User Profile 2** (favorite_genre: jazz, favorite_mood: relaxed, target_energy: 0.95, target_danceability: 0.95, target_acousticness: 0.95, likes_acoustic: True)

Top recommendations:

1. Coffee Shop Stories (Slow Stereo) — Score: 4.42 — genre match (+2.0), mood match (+1.0), acousticness close (+1.0), energy similarity (+0.42)
2. Gym Hero (Max Pulse) — Score: 1.98 — danceability close (+1.0), energy similarity (+0.98)
3. Quantum Leap (Future Logic) — Score: 1.98 — danceability close (+1.0), energy similarity (+0.98)
4. Fiesta Nights (La Rumba) — Score: 1.97 — danceability close (+1.0), energy similarity (+0.97)
5. Pixel Parade (Bitcrush) — Score: 1.93 — danceability close (+1.0), energy similarity (+0.93)

**User Profile 3** (favorite_genre: jazz, favorite_mood: relaxed, target_valence: 0.7, target_tempo: 90, likes_acoustic: True)

Top recommendations:

1. Coffee Shop Stories (Slow Stereo) — Score: 5.00 — genre match (+2.0), mood match (+1.0), tempo close (+1.0), valence close (+1.0)
2. Focus Flow (LoRoom) — Score: 2.00 — tempo close (+1.0), valence close (+1.0)
3. Golden Fields (Harvest Moon) — Score: 2.00 — tempo close (+1.0), valence close (+1.0)
4. Sunrise City (Neon Echo) — Score: 1.00 — valence close (+1.0)
5. Midnight Coding (LoRoom) — Score: 1.00 — valence close (+1.0)


### What happened when you disabled the mood check
When I disabled the mood check, songs that matched the user's favorite mood lost their bonus point. For User Profile 2 and 3, "Coffee Shop Stories" dropped in score but stayed at the top, and the total scores for all users were lower. The order of the top 5 changed for User Profile 3, and the reasons for each recommendation no longer included mood match. The system relied more on genre, tempo, valence, and energy similarity.

## Limitations and Risks


Limitations:
- Only works on a small set of songs
- Struggles if your favorite genre or mood isn’t in the catalog
- Can create “filter bubbles” by always picking the same genre or mood
- Doesn’t consider lyrics, popularity, or listening history

## Personal Reflection

Building this recommender showed me how complex are the systems used by music apps like Spotify, that has millions of users and certainly many more features than what my recommender system uses. I learned that it is hard to recommend music to people with very specific tastes. For example, users with extreme preferences (like very high energy) got only low-scoring, generic recommendations, making the system feel unresponsive for them. It also made me realize how much human judgment still matters in music recommendation, since the model can only work with the features it has and may miss important aspects of what makes a song enjoyable to a particular person.

I used the regular gpt 4 to help me, and I have to double check the changes it was making to the functions and if they made sense.

I was surprised on how the simple scoring system could still feel somehow personalized.

If I extended this project, I would provide change all the songs in the dataset to be from my own music library, so that I can test it with my own preferences to see if it really can give good recommendations.
